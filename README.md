# Future-hub

This project uses phpmyadmin as the local database

Please press import on the main dashboard on phpmyadmin and import the futurehub.sql file into there.
You may just need to create the table futurehub prior to import as then it knows where exactly to import.

The Zip file contains the pages that can be unzipped into the local xampp folder (under c:\xampp\htdocs)
Thus all the files will be found under c:\xampp\htdocs.

Granted this project isnt fully finished but is a rough prototype.
